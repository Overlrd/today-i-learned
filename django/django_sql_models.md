# Django SQL Models
Working on dinamic websites includes using databases.
The **[Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/)** offer very usefull way to interact with Sqlite Databases.
Django uses Classes called *model* to represents a database's tables as python Objects.
The table's content be edited directly from the model object and don't require writing custom SQL statments.
It makes interactions with databases more "easy" and less time consuming.
