# Query Selector

You can just select any item on the page , with the ```querySeclector``` by passing just like CSS , it's id, class or just it's type.
something like 
```js
querySelector(#container).style.color = 'somecolor' 
``` 
or just access and change the value(with the **innerHTML** function) or the behavior of an item. 

Example :

```js 
const el = document.querySelector(".myclass"); 
```

the el variable refers to the element you select and you can edit it's content , style , behavior .
