### Timsetamps

As i'm working on the CS50 Web course, i have to record small demo youtube videos for the projects i'm working on.
It's requested for the videos to have timestamps in their description ,that indicate where in the video the specific requirements are demonstrated.

To add timestamps to a video, you should add a list of key , value in the description.
the key is the time(in minute-second format) and the value is the title of this timestamp.

#### Demo

``` python

00:00 - start
05:00 - middle
07:30 - something
09-45 - something else

```
